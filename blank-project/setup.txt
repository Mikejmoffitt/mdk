This is a blank project. To use it, you'll want to do the following:

1) Copy the contents of blank-project to your own repo or directory for your project.

2) Clone `mdk` as a submodule in your new repo:

    $ git submodule add git@github.com:mikejmoffitt/mdk
    $ cd mdk && git checkout master

(it's also acceptable but not recommended to simply copy the `mdk` directory)

3) Try building.

    $ make

From then on, if you want to update `mdk`, you just need to do the following:

    $ git submodule update --remote --merge
    $ git add mdk && git commit -m "Updated MDK."

It is also acceptable to just download the latest and drop the `mdk` directory in.
