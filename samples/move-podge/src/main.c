/* Color notes

Per https://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2188
the VDP's DAC is somewhat nonlinear, and the actual usable levels
are 0 52 87 116 144 172 206 255.  Less shadow detail.

In web color format, these are the usable grays:
#000000, #343434, #575757, #747474, #909090, #ACACAC, #CECECE, #FFFFFF
